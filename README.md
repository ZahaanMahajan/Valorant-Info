# Valorant Info

A new Flutter project.

This project is a mobile application build with flutter having information about a fps game,
it's agents, maps, weapons, skins, bundle, etc...

Code is not at all optimised, no state management, no route management, no even folder management.
I am still working on the app.

# Here are some example screenshots from the app:
